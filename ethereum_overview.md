## What Is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that lets anyone deploy code in the form of smart contracts. These smart contracts are small programs that live on the blockchain, executing exactly as written without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. They provide the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) that can handle anything from digital assets to governance rules.

### Native Currency and Incentives

The network is powered by Ether (ETH), its native currency. ETH serves multiple roles: it pays for transaction fees (gas), rewards validators who secure the network, and acts as a liquid asset within decentralized finance ecosystems that run on Ethereum.

### How Consensus Works

Since September 2022, Ethereum has used a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In PoS, validators lock up ETH as collateral and, in return, earn the right to propose and attest to new blocks. Honest behavior earns rewards, while malicious behavior risks losing the staked ETH. This replaces the energy-intensive proof-of-work mining used in the early years of the network.

### Programmability and dApps

Developers write smart contracts in languages such as Solidity and Vyper. Once deployed, these contracts interact with users and other contracts through public function calls. This has enabled a rich ecosystem that includes decentralized finance platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming projects, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and identity solutions.

### Tooling and Infrastructure

Ethereum clients (e.g., Geth, Nethermind, Besu) maintain the blockchain state and validate new blocks. Layer 2 solutions and sidechains extend scalability by processing transactions off the main chain and committing aggregated results back to Ethereum. Wallets like MetaMask give users a way to manage keys and sign transactions securely.

### Governance and Roadmap

While there is no centralized authority, Ethereum evolves through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that the community debates and implements via client upgrades. The roadmap aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability through initiatives like sharding and rollup-centric development.
